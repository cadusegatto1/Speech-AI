This repository provides basic examples for performing Speech Recognition in Python using the Google Speech Recognition Engine. It includes code for recognizing speech from both microphones and audio files, as well as handling long audio files by breaking them into smaller chunks.


## Getting Started:

### ðŸ”§ Features

Microphone Input: Recognizes speech from live audio.
Audio File Input: Processes speech from local audio files.
Long Audio File Handling: Splits long audio files into chunks for processing.

```python
# Clone this repository
